***When you use this template for your datapack, feel free to delete the README.md file and the license and replace them with your own. :)***

Have you ever spent three hours fixing a datapack because of a Minecraft update? Well, I have!

*internal screaming*

*cough* *cough* structures→structure, functions→function, and tags... stays as tags?

This datapack is a template to help developers start making a new datapack without the tears of setting up the file tree. I got the idea because of the recent work that I have been doing on [DevCraft](https://dtar-github.github.io/server) (Go check it out ;) ), and I thought I could help a few souls. It can be hard to track all the changes Mojang has been making to datapacks lately.
